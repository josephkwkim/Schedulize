The semester will be broken in to 3 parts:Intro/Exploration and a long term project. In Intro/Exploration, students will have many hands on opportunities to start to build a common language to describe spacial investigations as well as creating them. This will consist of short projects, with each design investigation progressively building upon the previous exploration; these early projects will consist of both individual and group work. They will focus on Making.  The second half of the semester will consist of one long term project to be created individually, incorporating students? personal theories of architecture based on an overarching question.  Studio work will be supported by group discussion based upon critical review of student work, readings, slide presentations, videos and films. There will also be a few field trips. Students are encouraged to explore their own areas of interest with respect to their work in class. Self-motivation, class attendance and an open mind is mandatory, however, no prior architectural, engineering or artistic experience is required.

During that lecture, he had declared drawing dead for architects-this despite the fact that the most compelling explanations he made during his talk were done with rather good gestural drawings.  It had seemed to me that the work he showed lacked formal order, complexity, scale and proportion (goo would be a good word for my sense of it), and I have speculated ever since that a course in classical anatomy would be helpful in addressing those weaknesses in their idiom.  Closer to home, I began to think it would be important for our students because they (as all students do) will tend to pursue the formal clichs of our time: Maynes, Patrick Schumacher etc.    In effect, there is an assumption behind this course: that through drawing that focuses consciously upon the formal order of real organic conditions, we can come to assimilate a sense of that order in a way that can make it ultimately transferrable to design.  A more near-term goal is that by drawing organic shapes and forms, students will gain strength in understanding the geometry of non-rectilinear shapes and strengthen their ability to visualize them.

The class consists of students from different disciplines who collaboratively synthesize and implement several systems in a short period of time.

Upon completion of this course the students will be able to: work in a mixed physical-digital environment and laboratory, make effective use of standard hardware and software tools for physical computing, approach complex physical computing problems with a systematic overview that integrates iterative research and design steps, generate systems specifications from a perceived need, partition functionality between hardware and software, produce interface specifications for a system composed of numerous subsystems, use computer-aided development tools for design, fabrication and testing and debugging, evaluate the system in the context of an end user application or experience.

We will discuss the marvelous power of data mining concepts and tools applied to data via troves of current real-world examples, such as recommender systems, customer segmentation, etc. Throughout the course, we will use R, a powerful open-source statistical language and one of the main tools in data mining and business analytics, fast becoming a mainstream tool. With this tool, you will learn about variety of exploratory and predictive data analytics techniques such as Nave Bayes classifier, nearest neighbor approaches, decision trees, clustering algorithms, etc.\", \"prereqs\": \"36-202 or 70-208 or 36-208\", \"prereqs_obj\": {\"invert\": false, \"reqs_list\": [[\"36-202\", \"70-208\", \"36-208\"]]}, \"coreqs\": null, \"coreqs_obj\": {\"invert\": null, \"reqs_list\": null}, \"name\": \"Data Mining & Business Analytics\", \"units\": 9.0, \"department\": \"Business Administration\", \"lectures\": [{\"times\": [{\"days\": [1, 3], \"begin\": \"09:00AM\", \"end\": \"10:20AM\", \"building\": \"CMB\", \"room\": \"2035\", \"location\": \"Doha, Qatar\"}], \"name\": \"W\", \"instructors\": [\"Gasper, John\"]}], \"sections\": []}, \"70-381\": {\"desc\": \"An introduction to the nature and fundamentals of marketing and consumer behavior.

Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic). Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision-making. It thus contrasts the standard net present value rule used by static discounted cash flow analysis. The resulting managerial decisions and asset valuations can be very different when real options analysis is used rather than static discounted cash flow analysis.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations.  The emphasis is on process, not product -- devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development -- both of which are explored here.    We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included:  Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more.

Each 76-100 course is structured by the reading and writing objectives of the course as well as a vocabulary for writing in English, but some courses present different themes (or content) in their readings.\", \"prereqs\": null, \"prereqs_obj\": {\"invert\": null, \"reqs_list\": null}, \"coreqs\": null, \"coreqs_obj\": {\"invert\": null, \"reqs_list\": null}, \"name\": \"Reading and Writing in an Academic Context\", \"units\": 9.0, \"department\": \"English\", \"lectures\": [{\"times\": [{\"days\": [1, 3, 5], \"begin\": \"09:30AM\", \"end\": \"10:20AM\", \"building\": \"PH\", \"room\": \"A19C\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"A\", \"instructors\": [\"Gordon, Andrew\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [1, 3, 5], \"begin\": \"10:30AM\", \"end\": \"11:20AM\", \"building\": \"PH\", \"room\": \"A22\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"B\", \"instructors\": [\"Poznahovska, Maria\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [1, 3, 5], \"begin\": \"11:30AM\", \"end\": \"12:20PM\", \"building\": \"PH\", \"room\": \"226B\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"C\", \"instructors\": [\"Adams, Alexis\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [1, 3, 5], \"begin\": \"11:30AM\", \"end\": \"12:20PM\", \"building\": \"BH\", \"room\": \"145C\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"D\", \"instructors\": [\"Wright, Heidi\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [1, 3, 5], \"begin\": \"12:30PM\", \"end\": \"01:20PM\", \"building\": \"SH\", \"room\": \"222\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"E\", \"instructors\": [\"Dawson, John\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [1, 3, 5], \"begin\": \"02:30PM\", \"end\": \"03:20PM\", \"building\": \"WEH\", \"room\": \"5302\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"F\", \"instructors\": [\"Michael, Marissa\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [1, 3, 5], \"begin\": \"01:30PM\", \"end\": \"02:20PM\", \"building\": \"WEH\", \"room\": \"5207\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"G\", \"instructors\": [\"Michael, Marissa\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [2, 4], \"begin\": \"10:30AM\", \"end\": \"11:50AM\", \"building\": \"BH\", \"room\": \"140C\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"I\", \"instructors\": [\"Wright, Heidi\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [1, 3, 5], \"begin\": \"04:30PM\", \"end\": \"05:20PM\", \"building\": \"PH\", \"room\": \"A20\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"J\", \"instructors\": [\"Oreto, Rebecca\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [2, 4], \"begin\": \"01:30PM\", \"end\": \"02:50PM\", \"building\": \"PH\", \"room\": \"A19D\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"K\", \"instructors\": [\"Wright, Heidi\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [0, 2, 4], \"begin\": \"08:30AM\", \"end\": \"09:20AM\", \"building\": \"CMB\", \"room\": \"2049\", \"location\": \"Doha, Qatar\"}], \"name\": \"W\", \"instructors\": [\"Hodges, Adam\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [0, 2, 4], \"begin\": \"09:30AM\", \"end\": \"10:20AM\", \"building\": \"CMB\", \"room\": \"2051\", \"location\": \"Doha, Qatar\"}], \"name\": \"WW\", \"instructors\": [\"Hodges, Adam\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [0, 2, 4], \"begin\": \"09:30AM\", \"end\": \"10:20AM\", \"building\": \"CMB\", \"room\": \"1190\", \"location\": \"Doha, Qatar\"}], \"name\": \"X\", \"instructors\": [\"Hyman, Ludmila\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [0, 2, 4], \"begin\": \"08:30AM\", \"end\": \"09:20AM\", \"building\": \"CMB\", \"room\": \"3048\", \"location\": \"Doha, Qatar\"}], \"name\": \"XX\", \"instructors\": [\"Pessoa, Silvia\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [0, 2, 4], \"begin\": \"08:30AM\", \"end\": \"09:20AM\", \"building\": \"CMB\", \"room\": \"3044\", \"location\": \"Doha, Qatar\"}], \"name\": \"Y\", \"instructors\": [\"Reynolds, Dudley\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [0, 2, 4], \"begin\": \"09:30AM\", \"end\": \"10:20AM\", \"building\": \"CMB\", \"room\": \"3044\", \"location\": \"Doha, Qatar\"}], \"name\": \"YY\", \"instructors\": [\"Reynolds, Dudley\"]}, {\"times\": [{\"days\": [0, 2, 4], \"begin\": \"09:30AM\", \"end\": \"10:20AM\", \"building\": \"CMB\", \"room\": \"3048\", \"location\": \"Doha, Qatar\"}], \"name\": \"Z\", \"instructors\": [\"Mitchell, Thomas\"]}], \"sections\": []}, \"76-223\": {\"desc\": \"This course will take a transatlantic approach to what constitutes blackness as well as black literature and expression from the turn of the 20th century until the present.

Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence.

Post-1945 has typically been the catch-all to describe American literature after the modernist period, and has often been called contemporary. However, that designation now seems inadequate: writers who became prominent in the immediate postwar era are historically removed, and writers arising since 1980 form a distinctly different generation, with a different sensibility. This course will account for the immediate postwar period, with the working hypothesis that we need to create a new construal of American literature and its recent past.

In the early modern period, England had a complex multifaceted relation to the Islamic world. Since the Crusades, England had thought of the Islamic world as a deadly religious enemy to annihilate, but at the end of the sixteenth century, the Islamic world was also a key diplomatic ally against the Spanish archenemy, a fabulously rich trading partner in the world emporium of the Mediterranean sea, and an efficient model of empire to emulate in the Atlantic world. As a result, the Islamic world came to occupy a central place in English national imagination and maintained that place throughout the seventeenth century. What fantasies about the Islamic world does early modern English literature reveal? How do religion, race, gender, and sexuality intersect in the formation of those cultural fantasies? Do authors reinforce those fantasies or pressure them? How do specifically English social, political, and cultural issues inform literary representations of Islam? What image of England emerges when English authors use Islam as a mirror for the nation? In other words, what do texts about Islam tell us about early modern England? To answer those questions, we will read across genres, comparing romances, epic poems, plays, travel writing, pamphlets, and essays, and we will set canonical authors such as Chaucer, Spenser, Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Milton in conversation with other illuminating early modern writers such as Richard Knolles, George Sandys, Robert Daborne, Henry Stubbe, and Mary Pix.\", \"prereqs\": \"76-101\", \"prereqs_obj\": {\"invert\": false, \"reqs_list\": [[\"76-101\"]]}, \"coreqs\": null, \"coreqs_obj\": {\"invert\": null, \"reqs_list\": null}, \"name\": \"Representations of Islam in Early Modern England\", \"units\": 9.0, \"department\": \"English\", \"lectures\": [{\"times\": [{\"days\": [2, 4], \"begin\": \"01:30PM\", \"end\": \"02:50PM\", \"building\": \"PH\", \"room\": \"A19A\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"A\", \"instructors\": [\"Ndiaye, Ngara Noemie\"]}], \"sections\": []}, \"76-350\": {\"desc\": \"In this class, we will survey classic literary theories from Platos exiling the poets from his ideal republic, through the philosopher Immanuel Kants reflections on beauty, up to contemporary theories of deconstruction, Marxism, feminism, sexuality, and labor.

In the late 20th century, an interdisciplinary group that included geographers, urban studies scholars, architects, sociologists, anthropologists and literary theorists began to theorize the social construction of space.  They argued that space is something dynamically created that may be interpreted for the ways it creates meaning.

In early sixteenth century Europe, race was a complex system of power distribution that relied primarily on religious or rank-based difference. With the development of colonization and color-based slavery in the Atlantic world, the early modern racial matrix produced a new paradigm: Europeans started thinking about physiological difference - for which skin color was a shorthand - in racial terms too. How were those various racial paradigms (religion, rank, skin color) represented in one of the most important mass media of the time - theatre? How did those paradigms interact in one given play or one given national culture? Did they reinforce or work against one another? Which features were specific to nationally defined racial epistemes? Which features circulated across national borders? How did the translation and mistranslation of racial notions from one culture into another shape a sense of shared whiteness in early modern Europe? Which performance techniques did actors use to impersonate racial others, and what effect did those techniques have on spectators? In short, how did early modern theatre participate in the making of race? To answer those questions, we will focus on a rich corpus of plays staging Jews, Moors and Blackamoors, New World Indians, Gypsies, and Turks.

We will also consider the multi-sided personality and talents of Martin Luther, one of the most colorful figures in German history.  We will view not only Luther the theologian, but also Luther the song writer and propagandist, the teacher and mentor, the translator, the preacher, and last but not least, Luther the husband and father of six children.  To gain insight into Luthers unusual biography, we will read portions of the famous (infamous?) Tischreden, which are accounts of his personal conversations with his many students at the university in Wittenberg, and view several dramatic films about Luthers life that have been produced in recent decades.  On the darker side, we will examine (and try to understand) Luthers anti-Semitic remarks and his call for crushing the Peasants Revolt, which his Reformation helped to inspire.  This course will be taught entirely in German.\", \"prereqs\": \"82-320 or 82-323 or 82-327 or 82-426\", \"prereqs_obj\": {\"invert\": false, \"reqs_list\": [[\"82-320\", \"82-323\", \"82-327\", \"82-426\"]]}, \"coreqs\": null, \"coreqs_obj\": {\"invert\": null, \"reqs_list\": null}, \"name\": \"Power, Politics, & Religion: The German Reformation\", \"units\": 9.0, \"department\": \"Modern Languages\", \"lectures\": [{\"times\": [{\"days\": [2, 4], \"begin\": \"03:00PM\", \"end\": \"04:20PM\", \"building\": \"PH\", \"room\": \"226B\", \"location\": \"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"}], \"name\": \"A\", \"instructors\": [\"Hallstein, Christian\"]}], \"sections\": []}, \"82-450\": {\"desc\": \"This course permits in-depth, 400-level study in the following courses: 82-342 Spain: Language and Culture, 82-343 Latin America: Language and Culture, and 82-344 U.S. Latinos: Language and Culture.

FALL 2016: Youth Culture  Japanese society is currently confronted with a massive array of social and cultural anomalies among its youth.  In the culture, which values and emphasizes conformity, the phenomenon is utterly unprecedented.  Accordingly, in this course, we will first explore the defining features of these anomalies  by examining how Japanese youth are portrayed in modern day fictions and films.  We will then scrutinize the extent to which these portrayals actually reflect real lives of young Japanese by analyzing newspaper articles and essays commenting on the social issues surrounding them.  Finally, we will take a close look at the dramatic social changes, over the past three decades, to trace their long-term impacts  as a significant factor contributing to the emergence of the new culture, particularly with respect to the changing youth behaviors.

FALL 2017: Comics in the Digital Humanities: Coding Electronic Textualities - Comics (from cartoons to comic strips and books, to graphic novels) are types of text defined by a wide variety of content and intricate relationships between the pictorial and the textual. Latin American comics have steadily informed and transformed the mass-media and cultural landscapes for decades, and have become the object of serious scholarly attention in the humanities --most recently in the digital humanities. This course explores a corpus of selected comics with a focus upon what they can tell us about articulations of identity, society, culture, and community in Hispanic Latin America. We will read theory and criticism to help deepen our understanding of each work and the context in which it was produced. We will also use hands-on instruction in Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, for encoding and analyzing the structural, textual, visual, and bibliographic complexity of pictorial and textual elements in digitized comics. While editing, marking up, and structuring texts and archival materials, we will be implicitly reading and subjecting them to a certain kind of interpretation, making inferences, and embarking in theoretical explorations of issues involved in the process. Expectations include diligent reading, active participation, occasional presentations and discussion leading, two papers, and a final project. The course is taught entirely in Spanish.
